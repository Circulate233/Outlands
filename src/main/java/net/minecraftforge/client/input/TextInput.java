/**
 * Text that arrives without a key press behind it: an input method commit, or a paste.
 * <p>
 * Vanilla only ever sees such text as the character attached to a key event, which is why a commit either has to
 * invent key events for each character or write to the focused field directly. Both leave a screen that draws its
 * own text widget outside the loop. This is the channel for those screens and for anything that wants to observe
 * the text the game accepted, in the order it was accepted.
 * <p>
 * A {@link GuiScreen} implementing {@link Listener} is notified while it is the open screen, so a screen needs no
 * registration and cannot leak one.

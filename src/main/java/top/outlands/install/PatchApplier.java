/**
 * Applies the binary patch pack to a vanilla Minecraft jar and writes the result as an overlay jar.
 *
 * <p>This is the install step's worker. Modern loaders run an installer on first launch and keep the produced
 * jars next to their libraries; we do the same, except that the "installer" is this class and it is invoked by
 * {@code top.outlands.foundation} before the game's class loader exists (see {@code docs/install-step.md} in the
 * Foundation repository for the whole model).
 *
 * <p>The output is an <b>overlay</b>: only the classes the patches rewrite or add, nothing else. That makes it
 * provably equivalent to what runtime patching produces for those classes, and it lets everything else keep coming
 * from the vanilla jar the launcher already has. A full jar would have to be assembled from our recompiled tree,
 * which would also shadow classes that differ by nothing but line tables.
 *
 * <p>The classpath of the JVM that runs this is just the loader jar and the LZMA decoder, so nothing here may touch
 * Guava, log4j or any other FML dependency.
